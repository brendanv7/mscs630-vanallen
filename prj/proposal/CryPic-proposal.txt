CryPic

CryPic (pronounced “cryptic” without the “t”) is a web application that combines cryptography with
steganography. Users can write messages that will be encrypted using AES. The resulting ciphertext
will be converted to an image file, which can then be saved and sent to the recipient. Recipients
can upload the image they received in order to view the decrypted message.

Users will have the option of providing their own key or having the application generate a key for
them. The key will be encrypted using a static system key, and the ciphertext of the encrypted key
will be converted to pixels to be included in the image. This is done to eliminate the need for the
key to be transported as plaintext to the recipient.
